# TimerSettings
Here lies all of the files to upload the code to the timer boxes, the STL files to reprint them if necessary, and schematics of how the box is wired. The code is written for Arduino Nano.

How to Use Timer Box:
1. With units remaining OFF, turn Box ON.
2. Turn units ON
3. If appropriate screen on Box says "Light Detected" or "Final Time", push the button below to reset the box.
4. Make sure the unit's sensor is properly covered, then trigger light. 
5. When the unit's light has gone off, record your time and reset the screen by pushing the corresponding button.

NOTES:  • Pushing each button on the Box will reset the screen & reset the baseline Lux value of the corresponding photocell each time the unit is properly pressed.
        • The photocell detects off of a baseline lux value that can be reset by the button.
        • THE BOX WILL MELT IF YOUR BULBS ARE TOO HOT!
